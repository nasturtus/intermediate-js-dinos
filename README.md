# Dinosaurs App

## Description

Allows a user to enter various data such as Height, Weight, Diet preferences and randomly selects three dinosaurs for comparsion across the above data. Plain facts (not comparison) are presented for the rest of the dinosaurs. 

All together a 3 x 3 grid is displayed with the human being at the center and the rest of the titles occupied by dinosaur-related information i.e. species, image, and a plain fact or comparison statement.

## Credits
To return a random number given binary options (0, 1), I have used a [function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random#getting_a_random_integer_between_two_values_inclusive) documented in MDN.
